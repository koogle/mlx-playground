# Diffusion

A diffusion model implementation using Apple's MLX framework, optimized for Apple Silicon.

## Overview
This directory contains an implementation of a diffusion model for image generation. The project is currently in development with the basic structure in place.

## Components
- `model.py`: Diffusion model architecture implementation
- `scheduler.py`: Noise scheduling for the diffusion process
- `loss.py`: Loss functions for training
- `train.py`: Training script
- `data/`: Dataset handling utilities

## Features
- Diffusion-based image generation
- MLX optimization for Apple Silicon
- Efficient training pipeline

## Status
This component is still under development and may not be fully functional.
