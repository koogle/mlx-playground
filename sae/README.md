# Sparse Auto-Encoder (SAE)

A sparse auto-encoder implementation using Apple's MLX framework, optimized for Apple Silicon.

## Overview
This directory contains an implementation of sparse auto-encoders for exploring and understanding LLM internals.

## Components
- `sae.py`: Core sparse auto-encoder implementation
- `main.py`: Entry point for training and evaluation

## Features
- Implementation of sparse auto-encoders using MLX
- Tools for analyzing LLM activations
- Focus on understanding feature detection in language models
- Experiments with different sparsity approaches

## Status
This component is under active development and is being used to explore LLM internals.
